# Transfr

<h2>Description:</h2>
Transfr is a big project which main goal is to provide systems and tools for developers to create new training simulations. They make simulations for any industry that needs one. I was one of developers that created few simulations for them. The biggest challenge was to work with big project, knowing what is possible, always trying to use things that were provided by main team and trying to optimalize work for faster implementations of new simulations. I was the main developer which knew the most about this project in my company, I've been joining all calls with Transfr team for updates and I was responsible for introducing new developers (from company I worked for) into this project.

<h2>Engine and language:</h2>
Unity C#

<h2>Environments used:</h2>
Windows 10
Android

<h2>Features:</h2>

- VR Control via Unity XR SDK (OculusXR),
- VR interactions supported by VRTK SDK,
- Working with tween chains for training steps,
- Training part and exam part,
- Interactions with tools,
- Voice overs,
- Completing all tasks in order,

<h2>My role in the project:</h2>

- Using available tools for interactions,
- Configuring all tools for best outcome,
- Implementing training steps,
- Optimalizing code an functions to make new simulations easier,
- Working with very detailed storyboard,
- Creating estimations for new simulations,
- Pointing out issues found in storyboard,
- Code reviews for new cooworkers in my team,
- Participating in video calls with the Transfr team,
- Working on a repository which was used by lots of other developers
- Refactoring code,
- Testing and debugging simulations,
- Work management using Jira,
